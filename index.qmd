## NCEAS Training Series: Supporting Effective Collaboration in Working Groups

Welcome to the **NCEAS Working Group Training Series**, specially designed to help working groups collaborate more effectively throughout every stage of their research process. These trainings cover essential collaboration strategies and practical skills, from facilitation and communication to data management and version control.

This training series is designed to foster both individual development and effective team collaboration. Training topics offers practical guidance on group facilitation, strategies for clear and productive communication, and hands-on skills for managing data and projects in a collaborative environment. Whether you're getting ready for your first group meeting or fine-tuning established workflows, these trainings offer valuable tools to support your success.

### How to Participate

We encourage each team to:

1. **Review the training topics** listed in the schedule below.  
2. **Discuss with your group** which sessions interest you individually and which ones may benefit the group as a whole.  
3. **Register early** — space is limited! Use the registration links provided for each training.  

Monthly emails will provide details and reminders for upcoming sessions, so you won’t miss a thing.

### Logistics

- **All sessions are held via Zoom.**

Let’s build stronger, smarter collaborations — together.
