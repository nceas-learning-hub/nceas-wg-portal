## Data & Computational Resources
Explore the core infrastructure available to support your research‚Äîfrom managing large datasets to conducting computationally intensive analyses and sharing your results openly and reproducibly.

### Data Storage & Management

Working groups are encouraged to use **GitHub** for version control and collaborative code development. However, GitHub has a **100 MB file size limit** per file, making it unsuitable for storing large datasets. Depending on the size and format of your data, consider the following options:

1. For **small datasets (< 50 MB)** that are published and accessible via a persistent web link (e.g., data from **DataONE**), you are encouraged to reference the URL directly within your scripts to minimize redundancy and streamline reproducibility.

2. For **medium-sized datasets (larger than 50 MB but smaller than 100 GB)** or unpublished data that need to be shared internally, use a **shared Google Drive**. Many working groups already have shared Drives‚Äîif yours has not been set up, please contact the Data Science Trainer. Organizing raw data within the `"data"` folder in the shared Google Drive for consistency and ease of use.

3. For **large datasets (> 100 GB)**, please reach out to the Data Science Trainer to coordinate access to **NCEAS data servers**. This ensures appropriate infrastructure for high-capacity and long-term storage.

### High-Performance & Parallel Computing

Working groups at NCEAS can request access to **high-performance computing (HPC)** resources to support large-scale processing and computation.

- To obtain HPC access with **R/RStudio pre-installed**, contact the Data Science Trainer.
- For parallel programming support:
  - **Python Tutorials**:
    - [Parallel computing in Python](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2025-04-arctic/sections/parallel-programming.html)
  - **R Tutorial**:
    - [Parallel Computing with R](https://nceas-learning-hub.github.io/nceas-wg-portal/s10_r_parallel_computing.html)

These tools and resources can help you scale your workflows efficiently across multiple cores or nodes.

### R Tips

Here are some optional R modules that fall outside our regular working group training topics. If you have questions about R programming, feel free to reach out‚Äîwe can develop a custom module as part of our working group resources. These topics are designed to strengthen your data visualization and analysis skills using R:

- **Using `sf` for Spatial Data & Intro to Making Maps**  
  A hands-on tutorial introducing spatial data operations and basic mapping in R.

### Data Sharing & Publishing

To support open and reproducible science, NCEAS encourages working groups to make their data and code **Findable**. See the [relevant module](https://lter.github.io/ssecr/mod_next-steps.html) developed by the NCEAS-LTER team. 

- Publish datasets in trusted repositories such as the [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://edirepository.org/) using tools like [ezEML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lhEBWzIPQ) for metadata creation.
- **Code** should be versioned in **GitHub** and eventually published through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to obtain a DOI.
