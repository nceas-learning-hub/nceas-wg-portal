title: "Building a Communications Strategy"
---



### Workshop Description {.unnumbered}
Effective science communication starts long before results are published and develops alongside the research itself. This interactive Zoom workshop is designed for scientific working groups who want to think more strategically about communication and integrate it into their collaborative process.

Participants will learn how to clarify communication goals, identify priority audiences, and craft audience-centered messages and learn how to use tools such as the Compass SciComm Message Box. The workshop focuses on building shared understanding and practical approaches that working groups can revisit and apply throughout their project. Participants will leave better equipped to make intentional communication decisions and support the use and impact of their science.

### Learning Objectives{.unnumbered}

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Describe how strategic communication can be integrated into working group science throughout the life of a project, not only at publication
- Apply a structured framework (e.g., the Compass SciComm Message Box) to think through audiences, messages, and relevance
- Identify priority audiences and clarify why their science matters to those groups
- Recognize how communication goals, messages, and platforms are connected and evolve over time
- Identify practical next steps for incorporating communication planning into future working group meetings
